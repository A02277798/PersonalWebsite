<h2>I am a Jon M. Huntsman School of Business student majoring in information systems with a data engineering emphasis and minoring in business consulting. My projected graduation date is May 2025, and I have earned a 4.0 GPA while working 20 hours per week. 

I am familiar with Python and SQL programming languages and have used them to solve business problems, organize information, and create data visuals in an educational environment. I have experience with Microsoft Office applications due to my education and past employment as an accounting intern at Wasatch Property Management. Additionally, I have enjoyed taking courses at Utah State University focused on change initiatives and data-driven decision-making. In my current role as a tennis instructor at Sports Academy and Racquet Club, I am known as a reliable, hard-working, organized employee who excels at client interactions. I will bring this same work ethic paired with communication and problem-solving skills to companies in the future. 

I am looking for an internship in the summer of 2024 that will provide opportunities to gain experience in business consulting and data analytics. Ideally, I would want this internship to lead to a mutually beneficial long-term employment opportunity that fits the professional goals of both parties.</h2>
